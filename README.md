## üìà Architecture & Design

Keep in Touch follows a **layered architecture** that promotes clear separation of concerns:

### Layered Design:
1. **Presentation Layer** (Views)
    - Responsible for rendering **Thymeleaf** templates and displaying dynamic content to the user.

2. **Controller Layer** (Endpoints)
    - Handles incoming HTTP requests and routes them to appropriate services.

3. **Service Layer** (Business Logic)
    - Processes the business rules and communicates with the DAO layer.

4. **DAO Layer** (Database Access)
    - Manages the database interactions using **JPA** and **Hibernate** for smooth data persistence.

5. **Security Layer** (Authentication & Authorization)
    - Ensures that sensitive data is securely encrypted, with proper role-based access control.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
To run **Keep in Touch**, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Java 21**
- **MySQL 8.0+**
- **Maven 3.6+**

### 2. Clone the Repository
- git clone https://github.com/9elmaz9/keep_in_touch
- cd keep-in-touch

---
### 3. Database Setup üõ†Ô∏è (External Properties)

To set up your MySQL database for **Keep in Touch** using external properties, follow these steps:

1. **Create a new MySQL database**:
   - Open your MySQL terminal and run the following command to create the database:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE keep_in_touch;
     ```

2. **Create an external properties file**:
   - Store your database configuration in an **external `application.properties`** or `application.yml` file. This file should be located outside the application JAR for easier maintenance.

3. **Configure the external properties**:
   - Add the following properties to your external `application.properties` file:

     ```properties
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/keep_in_touch
     spring.datasource.username=your_username
     spring.datasource.password=your_password
     ```

   - Ensure the `url`, `username`, and `password` fields are updated with your MySQL credentials.

4. **Point to the external configuration**:
   - When starting your Spring Boot application, specify the location of your external `application.properties` file:
     ```bash
     java -jar your-app.jar --spring.config.location=file:/path/to/your/application.properties
     ```

   - Replace `/path/to/your/application.properties` with the actual path to your external configuration file.

5. **Run database migrations** (if applicable):
   - If you're using database migrations (e.g., Flyway or Liquibase), ensure that your external configuration file includes migration settings, or they will run automatically when you start the application.

6. **Verify the connection**:
   - Start your MySQL server and run the application with the external configuration file. Verify that the tables are generated and that the connection is successful.

By using an external `application.properties` file, you can easily manage your database configurations without modifying the application code itself.

     ```bash
     java -jar target/your-app.jar --spring.config.location=file:/path/to/your/application.properties
     ```

   - Ensure the path to the `application.properties` file is correct.

3. **Access the application**:
   - Once the application is running, open your browser and go to:
     ```
